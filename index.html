    <p>That's my first attempt using this program, so I hope I can do it right.
        I am <emphasis>Jefferson</emphasis> and I'm from Brazil, from a very hot region. I've never used such kind of programs or knowlodge
        But I am <strong>enjoying</strong> it. There is a scripture I like that helps me to keep believing that I can do 
        great things. It says "â€œBehold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise."
